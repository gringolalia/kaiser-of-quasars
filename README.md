# Quasar, Science-Fiction Schemed

> Generated with [the Quasar CLI](https://quasar.dev/start/quasar-cli) then themed typographically and chromatically and treated as a sandbox for layout and UI components and combinations of the three. Uses [the Quasar-Nuxt module](https://github.com/NickHurst/nuxt-quasar). Based on some Wikipedia-like list of all-time sci-fi films.

## Taking Command Line

```
quasar init quasar-the-amazing

cd quasar-the-amazing

yarn run dev

yarn add nuxt-quasar

quasar dev

quasar new <app asset>

quasar serve

yarn run dev

yarn run build 

```

The category «app assets» covers components and pages and layouts and store modules &mdash; similar to Angular.

## Development Notes

> A work in ordem e progresso. Delete unwanted folders under `pages` and use `quasar new` to add your own. The `router` will track contents of this folder and generate navigation accordingly.
